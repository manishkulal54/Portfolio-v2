const aboutMe = `I'm a results-oriented software developer with an extensive
              background in developing solid, efficient, and user-focused
              applications. Adept at all phases of the development cycle from
              conception and design to deployment, I thrive on crafting clean,
              maintainable code and overcoming real-world issues creatively and
              with precision.I keep myself updated on new technologies, like
              working autonomously and collaboratively, and I constantly look
              for opportunities for personal development through challenging
              experiences. Apart from coding, I read about new tools, come up
              with ideas for products, and interact with tech communities.`;
